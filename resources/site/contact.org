Before having my own children, I taught art classes at Mills and spent
my free time in the garden. I learned a tremendous amount raising my own
children and having a house full of my son's friends. Now both have
moved away from home and are pursuing their studies. One of my passions
is to work with infants and toddlers and to help them grow into
confident children ready for their next step. I started the childcare
four years ago and I have devoted one floor of my house to the daycare,
with a separate entrance and its own kitchen, so that the children have
a space just for them. I love to watch them explore, teach them about
the natural world and let them get messy! In my free time, I am tending
to my garden, cooking and painting.
