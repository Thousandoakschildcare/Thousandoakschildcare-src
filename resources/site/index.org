* Description

Thousand Oaks DayCare is a small, home-based daycare located in North
Berkeley.  We provide a nurturing, loosely structured environment for your child
to grow and explore. Daily activities include music, art projects, movement,
gardening, walks to the park, story time and imaginary play. We use a play based
approach to learning with an emphasis on discovery and  self-expression. We
provide organic, locally grown snacks and meals daily. Special dietary needs can
be accommodated. The childcare is spacious, full of natural light, with lots of
toys for both indoor and outdoor play.

There are currently openings available in

little ones!
